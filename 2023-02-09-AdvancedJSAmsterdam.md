# AdvancedJS Amsterdam February 9th 2023
This presentation was a talk about AI and how it can be used in JavaScript. It was given at the AdvancedJS meetup in Amsterdam on February 9th 2023.

The presentation was a short, 10 minute, lightning talk. The slides and generated code are available below.

In this presentation I'm doing a walkthrough of the code that was generated by the AI, which was themed around Star Wars. 

For this project the use of ChatGPT and Github Copilot, and none of the code was handcrafted.
